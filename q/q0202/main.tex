This is a closed-book, no compiler, 5 minute quiz.

Evaluate the followng integer expressions as \cpp\ would, one step at a
time.
Each step must either be the computation of one single operator
or the removal of parentheses.
Here are some examples:
\begin{console}
1 + 2 + 3
= 3 + 3          by 1 + 2 = 3
= 6              by 3 + 3 = 6
\end{console}
\begin{console}
1 + (2 + 3)
= 1 + (5)        by 2 + 3 = 5
= 1 + 5          by (5) = 5
= 6              by 1 + 5 = 6
\end{console}

Grading stops once you have an error.
Each line of computation is worth 1 point.
Write legibly.
If I cannot read what you write, I will grade it as a wrong answer.

\begin{answercode}
1 + 3 - 4 * 5 + 2 / 3

= 1 + 3 - 20 + 2 / 3                       by 4 * 5 = 20
= 4 - 20 + 2 / 3                           by 1 + 3 = 4
= -16 + 2 / 3                              by 4 - 20 = -16
= -16 + 0                                  by 2 / 3 = 0
= -16                                      by -16 + 0 = -16

\ANSWER
\begin{answercode}
1 + 3 - 4 % 5 / 2 + 2 / (3 + 5 - 4) / 2

= 1 + 3 - 4 / 2 + 2 / (3 + 5 - 4) / 2       by 4 % 5 = 4
= 1 + 3 - 2 + 2 / (3 + 5 - 4) / 2           by 4 / 2 = 2
= 1 + 3 - 2 + 2 / (4) / 2                   by 3 + 5 - 4 = 4
= 1 + 3 - 2 + 2 / 4 / 2                     by (4) = 4
= 1 + 3 - 2 + 0 / 2                         by 2 / 4 = 0
= 1 + 3 - 2 + 0                             by 0 / 2 = 0
= 4 - 2 + 0                                 by 1 + 3 = 4
= 2 + 0                                     by 4 - 2 = 2
= 2                                         by 2 + 0 = 2
